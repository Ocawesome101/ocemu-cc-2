# OCEmu-CC 2

This is my second attempt at an OpenComputers emulator in ComputerCraft.

The various 11f38616-\* folders are test OSes.

## Operating Systems

The following operating systems have been tested under OCEmu-CC 2, and all work fully under OpenComputers:

### OpenOS

Boots, freezes at `Initializing system...`

### OC-DOS

Works.

### Open Kernel 1.0

Boots, slightly buggy, many features untested.

### Open Kernel 2

Boots, cursor has a heart attack

### PsychOS 2

Boots, does not receive keyboard input.

### Photon

Crashes with `/sys/core/init.lua:58: attempt to call global 'require' (a nil value)`.
